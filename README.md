## Criteria

The website could be used as the answer to the question alone, without any explanations (Since they will be on the website itself.) The website should serve only one purpose.
The exception type of question is `What is X?`, and they won't be accepted since there will be so many websites.
Another exception is informative websites that have many answers like caniuse.com or whatwebcando.today, ideally the website should answer only one question.
